 <h2>Project</h2>
 <h3>Gym tinder</h3>
 <p> I always go for joging after every 2 days and also workout.
    My siblings dont like working out and i find it boring working out by myself.
    My gym tinder app is to connect people like me to chat with each other and create a routine with each other.
    It also gives people an opportunity to bond with each other and improve each others fitness.</p>

    <h3>AttIn Web</h3>
    <p>When I was in  University, i  struggled searching for an attachment and i dint know which organizations i should applt to.
        At the moment i just finished University and finding an internship is a struggle. I want to create AttIn website
        to create a link between Institutions and students for easier communication and application.</p>
